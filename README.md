# Frontend Mentor - TO DO solution

This is a solution to the [TO DO app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW/hub). 

Probably it could be done in a more simple and straightforward way, but I decided to make it with Redux. 
I would appreciate your comments and suggestions, because I just learning.
